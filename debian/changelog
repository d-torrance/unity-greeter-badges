unity-greeter-badges (0.4-0ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/install
    - Simplify file to use wildcard.  We will handle the special cases
      in debian/rules.
    - Remove executable bit; not needed since we no longer use dh-exec.
  * debian/control
    - Remove dh-exec from Build-Depends; no longer needed.
  * debian/rules
    - Add override_dh_install target to remove badges found in other packages
      and fix resulting broken symlinks.  This function was previously
      performed by dh-exec using debian/install, but this was harder to
      maintain.
